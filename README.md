# ARNN-implementation
PyTorch implementation for AAAI-20 paper ([An Attentional Recurrent Neural Network for Personalized Next Location Recommendation](https://ojs.aaai.org/index.php/AAAI/article/view/5337))

Referred to [https://github.com/hhy-huang/ARNN-master](https://github.com/hhy-huang/ARNN-master), thanks here. On this basis, I made some imporvements, which greatly reduce the time consumed by data preprocessing.
